# Star-Galaxy-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Algorithm

Galaxy Image Classification using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network is presented in this
project. The galaxy can be classified based on its features into three main categories:
Elliptical, Spiral, and Irregular. The proposed system aims to classify stars and galaxies from
the input image using CNN and transfer learning algorithms like vgg, resnet, inception, etc
